So, this is obviously incomplete. However, what the whole idea of the website is like a place to put basic data about a character that the user makes.
In the user should never touch the code. There should be a button to edit the page (There isn't one yet) and once I implement the data base, it should start working. 
There is also missing stuff like I want to add a carrousel thing, for example, and the goal in this page is to access a character information whenever the person is, so the page is also responsive.
In the future, there should be also an option to create an additional template so that the user can have more than one character in the page.
